This is an R Shiny app for interactively viewing the results of the Louvain
method for community detection.

For the moment I'm using prebuilt graphs (in .json files in ./www/data) from
Baylor's protein-protein interaction data.

To run:

1. Download and install R Studio
2. Install the Shiny package by running the command

    install.packages("Shiny")

    at the R command line

3. Open all of the .R files in this repo and click "run app" in R studio
