This is an R Shiny app for interactively viewing the results of the Louvain
method for community detection.

For the moment I'm using prebuilt graphs (in .json files in ./www/data) from
Baylor's protein-protein interaction data.

To run:

1. Download and install R Studio
2. Install the necessarypackages by running the commands
    install.packages("shiny")
    install.packages("shinydashboard")
    install.packages("DT")
    install.packages("jsonlite")
    install.packages("igraph")
    install.packages("ggplot2")
    install.packages("rstackdeque")

3. Open all of the .R files in this repo and click "run app" in R studio
