(1) filtering the network. 
    just show protein-protein interactions (after running community detection on everything)
    have some dialog box for picking the interaction we want to show

(2) Search box ? Find which community a node is in and then highlight it in the graph

(3) Summary of network 

(4) fix the graph layout

(5) Clean up summary box. 
    Order nodes by degree
    Remove row label
    if time: click on row in box highlights node in graph


(6) Add other info tabs
    pagerank
    coloring options

(7) Handling the "zoom" better
    Being able to up arbitrary levels (how do I show it, how do I do it)
    Layout issues .. no more random position (the same graph should have the same layout. either do it in R or stop the random javascript part)

(8) Fix color scheme (keep everything to shinydashboard)
