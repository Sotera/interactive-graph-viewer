Hi John

Apologies,
I started writing an email sometime ago but decided that it would be better to have phonecall because I didn't feel my feedback may not make sense ... And then I had to travel for sometime and a few things fell off the radar.

-I like the idea, I open the page and network looks very cool
-One of the big problems is that the sub networks are too big to be useful.
-It would be useful to drop down to 1 or 2 types entities
-Biology has nested communities. They can have large communities (~100-1000) but the function is not very specific. The large community usually is a collection of smaller communities. The more interesting communities would be smaller.
-Some sort of Label information that could be associated with the sub networks would be helpful. Maybe highlighting the most connected entities in those list. 
-A search function would be useful. Typically a user would be studying a particular protein or drug.
-network that are a single edge seemed to be weighted as much large communities. single edges should be pushed to the side some how.

I am going to sit with some students and get some more feedback today.

Will you be attend next week? Again for the delay, Thanks for doing this.

Best, Angela
